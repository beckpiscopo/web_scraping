# Practice web scraping project

This is code is from a <a href="teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> tutorial I completed. I wanted to learn how to scrape data
from the web, but I also wanted to further develop my python skills. 

### This project taught me: 

<ul>
  <li>The basics of Beautiful Soup and Scrapy</li>
  <li>How to use a web crawler to access an API</li>
  <li>How to use a scraper for site testing</li>
  <li>An introduction to <a href="https://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a></li>
</ul>
